            Running a successful restaurant isn’t just about great food. A safe,
            clean, and compliant kitchen is equally important. One of the most
            critical systems in any commercial kitchen is the kitchen exhaust
            hood and ventilation system. A properly installed system removes
            heat, smoke, grease, and odors while helping your restaurant meet
            fire and health safety requirements.

          <>
            A kitchen exhaust hood is installed above cooking equipment such as
            stoves, grills, fryers, and ovens. Its main purpose is to remove
            smoke and steam, control excess heat and moisture, capture grease
            particles, and eliminate cooking odors. The system pulls
            contaminated air through filters and ductwork Vand releases it
            safely outside.

            Proper ventilation improves fire safety and ensures code compliance.
            Grease buildup is a major fire hazard, and a well-designed exhaust
            system helps meet NFPA and local fire codes. It also improves air
            quality, prevents smoke-filled kitchens, keeps temperatures cooler,
            and helps restaurants pass health inspections without penalties.

            Type I exhaust hoods are designed for heavy-duty cooking equipment
            that produces grease and smoke, such as fryers, grills,
            charbroilers, and woks. These are required for most restaurants.
            Type II exhaust hoods are used for heat and steam with minimal
            grease, such as dishwashers, ovens, and steamers.
